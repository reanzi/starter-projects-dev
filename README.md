Simply clone the repository or download and unzip it into the directory you want ( your new project folder).

Make sure Node is installed in your system ( download it here https://nodejs.org)

Also make sure you have a Gulp-CLI installed ( if not run "npm install -g gulp-cli")

When done; run npm install and you'll be all set to roll
